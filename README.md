# Hateful Speech Checker
---
#### How an NLP assistant is helping to cope with hate speech on social networks
This project has been run in the context of a final examination for the [__MSc Artificial Intelligence & Business Analytics__](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12518036/) of __Toulouse Business School__.
The problematic given was: _"How limiting hateful speech on Twitter?"_.

We have thought that to limit effectively the diffusion of agressive contents on __Social Network Sites (SNS)__ the platform should present how the content is perceived by the system to the user, highlight the strongest word and suggest recommendations. Doing so, the user is fully aware of the consequence of his content and can choose to conform his speech or publish it as it is. In both case, it produces insightful behavioural information on the SNS's user to classify them.

#### Technologies used
Our app has involved a deep understanding of several NLP algorithms as our functions perform __sentiment analysis__, __classification__ and __fill mask__ tasks.
The languages and framework used are:
* Python
* Flask
* HTML / CSS
* JS
* PyTorch
